# autonomous_robots_course_pp3
Project 3 - Autonomous Robots Course

In this project you will implement the methods for four control laws:
* Move to Point
* Follow Path
* Move to Pose
* Follow Line

The starter files contain code that implement most of the needed functionality
* 03_robot.cpp - Robot class. Here is where you need to implement the control laws. 
** Find sections between the following markers:
```
    // WRITE YOUR CODE: BEGIN
    ...
    // WRITE YOUR CODE: END
```
** After you implement the methods, you also need to tune the constants in each controller to improve performance as much as possible
* 03_controllers.cpp - this is the main program that uses the Robot class. 
* 03_test.cpp - this program helps send paths to the controllers program without having to manually publish messages from the terminal. Feel free to try different paths

Make sure to understand all the code in the starter files before you write your changes.
